*Task:- Bank Customer Churn Model*

**Description:**
A churn model aims to proactively identify customers who are likely to churn, enabling the bank to take appropriate actions to retain them. By analyzing historical data and customer behaviour patterns, the model can predict the likelihood of churn for individual customers or segments of customers.

The model typically incorporates various factors and variables indicative of customer churn. These may include customer demographics, transactional history, account balance, customer complaints, interaction frequency, and engagement levels with the bank's services. External factors such as economic conditions, competitive offerings, and market trends may also be considered.

The churn model uses machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and identify patterns and correlations that can predict future churn. Commonly used algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. The model is trained on a labelled dataset, where customers are classified as churned or non-churned based on their historical behaviour.
